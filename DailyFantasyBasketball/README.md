# Daily Fantasy Basketball

## Matthew Gillies

My project will be to design an application that
contains information about daily fantasy basketball. 
This application will allow the user 
to construct a lineup (or multiple lineups) of NBA 
players and enter these lineups into certain contests
each day. Each player will be given a certain salary based
on their previous performance, and there will be a cap on 
the total salary allotted per lineup. For my project each 
lineup will consist of **10** players, with a salary cap
of **$600**. Different contests will be created with
varying entry fees, and a corresponding prize pool. The user
will also have a balance on the application to determine if
they are able to enter a certain contest.  
Players will accumulate fantasy points through the 
statistics they collect in real life games. 

**Fantasy points will be distributed as:**
- 1 FP per point scored
- 1 FP for every 3-pointer scored 
- 2 FP per rebound
- 2 FP per assist
- 3 FP per block
- 3 FP per steal
- BONUS: 20 FP if player is ejected from game

This application will be used by individuals who are
interested in basketball/fantasy basketball and are 
willing to risk some money in order to possibly make 
a very large profit. There are already many 
applications for daily fantasy basketball, however
this application will use a unique scoring system. I chose to 
create this application as I am an avid daily fantasy player
myself. Ever since I began playing daily fantasy I have
always wanted to create my own scoring system, and this 
project has created an opportunity for me to do so. Also,
I have a strong interest in sports statistics in general, 
and I hope to use this project to present my skills to
future employers in the sports statistics industry. 

##User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to create a lineup and fill the lineup with players
- As a user, I want to be able to see the total fantasy points my lineup has accumulated
- As a user, I want to be able to enter my lineup(s) into a contest(s) with my balance
- As a user, I want to be able to input statistics that my players have accumulated
- As a user, I want to be able to save my lineup
- As a user, I want the option to be able to load my saved lineup from file

**Note:** Due to the nature of daily fantasy basketball it is not necessary to save data regarding contests or
statistics as these reset and change daily

**Note:** Please ignore all "extra" methods that are not used in the ui. I plan to use these for my own further 
exploration.

Lineup has been added to a contest.

##Phase 4: Task 3
If I had the opportunity to refractor my code I would first remove the Account class and add the parameters for 
Account into the Lineup class. The Account class seems to be a bit redundant and is rarely used in itself. I would also 
reduce the number of fields within the Player class, as it becomes a hassle to create ten players with four parameters
each. Simply including name and salary would be sufficient for this project, although the other parameters would 
be necessary if I were fully developing my app. Lastly I would change the formatting of my gui application to make it
more visually appealing. To do this I would move the text panels and image into a "cleaner" format.
